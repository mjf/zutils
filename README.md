# Zone Utils

The utility named `zf` (short for "zone filter") serves the purpose of
filtering and reformatting the output generated by the `dig(1)` tool.

The utility named `zonefold` can fold long DNS records.

Most of the other utilities are primarily dedicated to the generation of
DNS records, notably TLSA (`tlsa`) and DKIM (`dkim`).

The essential requirements include standard Unix tools such as `sed`,
`awk`, and `grep`, in addition to OpenSSL.
