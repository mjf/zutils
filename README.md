# Zone Utilities

The utility named `zf` (short for "zone filter") serves the purpose of
filtering and reformatting the output generated by the `dig(1)` tool.
It's dependency is the `zht` utility that reformats time values to
human-readablel form. The petite `z` utility is just wrapper around
the `dig(1)` tool.

The utility named `zfold` can fold long DNS records and is prerequisity
for some other utilities. Most of the other utilities are primarily
dedicated to the generation of DNS records, notably TLSA (`tlsa`) and
DKIM (`dkim`).

The essential requirements for all the utilities include standard Unix
tools such as `sed`, `awk`, and `grep`, in addition to OpenSSL.
